# Major League Baseball Start-To-Finish Project
[Back to Homepage](https://drewsp7.github.io).

The purpose of this project is to start with a full soup-to-nuts project that starts with web scraping, clean data using ETL processes in Alteryx, and query that data for a Machine Learning Analysis.

#### Part 1: Here is a tutorial where I scraped 2019 hitting statistics with help of the CodeAcademy tutorial:

#### Part 2: Added model creation using R. Determined using two X features (BB_Ratio and Hits_Game) were best to use for my model since they provided the best p-value, did not suffer from multi-collinearity, and produced the lowest RSS (Residual Sum of Squares).
